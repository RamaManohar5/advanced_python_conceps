"""
The collections module in Python implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose
 built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.
The following tools exist:
- namedtuple : factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields 
- OrderedDict : dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added 
- Counter : dict subclass for counting hashable objects 
- defaultdict : dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values 
- deque : list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end

In Python 3 some more modules exist (ChainMap, UserDict, UserList, UserString). See https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html for further references.

    A deque is a double-ended queue. It can be used to add or remove elements from both ends. 
    Deques support thread safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque 
        with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction. 
    The more commonly used stacks and queues are degenerate forms of deques
        where the inputs and outputs are restricted to a single end.
